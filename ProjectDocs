Project Overview
The Dynamic Express API is a basic Express.js server project designed to demonstrate the use of different HTTP methods. It supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and can handle dynamic routes and query parameters. The goal is to learn how to set up a simple server, manage incoming requests, and respond dynamically.



Features

Basic Express.js setup
Handling various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Dynamic routing
Handling query parameters and request bodies
Listening to incoming requests and sending appropriate responses
Prerequisites

Getting Started
steps to set up and run the project:

Step 1: Initialize the Project
Create a new directory for the project and navigate into it:

mkdir dynamic-express-api
cd dynamic-express-api
Initialize a new npm project:


npm init -y
Step 2: Install Express
Install Express.js, which is the main framework for building the server:there other frmeworks like 


npm install express
Step 3: Create the Server File
Create a new file named index.js and set up the Express server:


// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Basic routes
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Handling dynamic GET requests with query parameters
app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
    const { name, age } = req.query;
    res.json({ message: `Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.` });
});

// Handling POST requests
app.post('/api/data', (req, res) => {
    const { name, age } = req.body;
    res.json({ message: `Received data for ${name}, age ${age}` });
});

// Handling PUT requests
app.put('/api/data/:id', (req, res) => {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const { name, age } = req.body;
    res.json({ message: `Updated record ${id} with name ${name} and age ${age}` });
});

// Handling DELETE requests
app.delete('/api/data/:id', (req, res) => {
    const { id } = req.params;
    res.json({ message: `Deleted record with id ${id}` });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

Step 4: Run the Server
Start the server with the following command:

node index.js
Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser to see the server response.

Step 5: Test the Endpoints
Use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or cURL to test the endpoints:

GET Request:

URL: http://localhost:3000/api/data?name=John&age=25
Response: { "message": "Hello, John! You are 25 years old." }
POST Request:

URL: http://localhost:3000/api/data
Body: { "name": "Alice", "age": 30 }
Response: { "message": "Received data for Alice, age 30" }
PUT Request:

URL: http://localhost:3000/api/data/123
Body: { "name": "Bob", "age": 40 }
Response: { "message": "Updated record 123 with name Bob and age 40" }
DELETE Request:

URL: http://localhost:3000/api/data/123
Response: { "message": "Deleted record with id 123" }
